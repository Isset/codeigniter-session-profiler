CodeIgniter-Session-Profiler
================

 * Adds session data to the profiler in CodeIgniter 2.0
 * Adds a table row for each item of session data with the key and value
 * Shows both CI session data and custom session data

Note: I did not write the original implementation, I just adapted it
for CodeIgniter >= 2.0 . You can find the implementation for 
CodeIgniter < 2.0 here:
